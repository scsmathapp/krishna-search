However, Śrī Chaitanya, whose charming figure was cloaked in the fresh garments of a radiant renunciate, presented consistent arguments in conjunction with the Vedic literatures, and easily checked and destroyed the scholar’s atheistic interpretations.

But when considering the flow of dedication’s sweet mellows, Lord Gaurāṅga described the ultimate aspect of the Supreme Lord’s personality to be Śrī Gopījanavallabha, whose divine figure is the unlimited reservoir of all the primary and secondary mellows tasted in pure devotion.
