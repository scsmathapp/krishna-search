Initially, Māyā, the shadow of the chit potency or divine potency, was inactive; also, the elements of her expanse of ingredients that would form the efficient cause of creation were separate and unamalgamated. By Kṛṣṇa's will, that is, by the agency of the power of Mahā-Viṣṇu, the instrumental and efficient parts of māyā were united, and the effect in the form of the material world was manifest. Despite that, throughout that entire function the Supreme Lord Himself remained united with His divine potency, Yoganidrā. The word 'Yoganidrā' or 'Yogamāyā' should be understood as follows: the nature of the divine potency is illuminating or revelatory, while the nature of Her shadow potency is to manifest the darkness of mundane ignorance. When Kṛṣṇa wishes to illuminate or reveal something in the affairs of the material world of darkness, He executes the task by contacting (yoga) the inert shadow of Māyā with the super-power of His divine potency; and this is the constitution of 'Yogamāyā'.",

The beauty of rasa in relationship with the Supreme Lord is manifest by its variegatedness, with four basic attributes known as vibhāva (subject and object), anubhāva (illuminating symptoms), sāttvika (particular emotional symptoms) and vyabhichārī (particular secondary transitory symptoms); such rasa full of variegatedness is ever-present in Goloka and Vaikuṇṭha.",

So different varieties in the nature of the male and female paramour, variegatedness in rasa of those identities, the soil, water, rivers, mountains, gateways, groves, cows, etc.—all these ingredients of Gokula are correspondingly and intrinsically present in Goloka; only the mundane connotation ascribed to this realm by persons of mundane conception is absent. According to the eligibility of the devotee, there are distinctly varied revelations in the variegated Pastimes of Vraja. To form a single criterion to determine which portions of those revelations may be illusory and which may be pure is difficult. The more the eyes of devotion are anointed or adorned with the salve of love, the more the pure will gradually reveal itself. So there is no necessity of argument; argument does not enhance anyone's eligibility—the depth of the plane of Goloka is of inconceivable subtleness. To try to conceive the inconceivable, like the futile pounding of empty grain-husk, can only come to nought. Therefore one must desist from the attempt of knowledge and attain realization by the devotional pursuit.
