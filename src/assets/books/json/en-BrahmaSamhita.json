According to His sweet will, the līlā potency also infuses the hearts of His personal associates with the devotional dispositions appropriate to their service.

In His manifest Pastimes, Kṛṣṇa frequents Gokula, Mathurā and Dvārakā.

That form which is nondifferent from Svayaṁ-rūpa but manifests a different form and character is called <span class=\"e3\">Tad-ekātma-rūpa</span>. Tad-ekātma-rūpa is of two types—vilās and svāṁśa. When by the play of Kṛṣṇa's inconceivable potency His generally similar form appears in a different form, it is called vilās. For example, the vilās form of Govinda is Nārāyaṇ, the Lord of Vaikuṇṭha; and the vilās form of the Lord of Vaikuṇṭha is Vāsudeva (of the first quadruple expansion). That form which, as in the case of vilās, is nondifferent from Svayaṁ-rūpa yet exhibits less power than the vilās form, is called svāṁśa. Examples are Saṅkarṣaṇ, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, etc., the three Puruṣa-avatārs headed by Mahā-Viṣṇu,§ the Līla-avatārs of Matsya, etc., the Manvantar-avatārs and the Yuga-avatārs. When Janārdan (Kṛṣṇa) allots His potencies of Knowledge, Devotion, Creation, Service, Universal Sustenance, Gravitational Force, Discipline of miscreants, etc., and infuses and empowers specially selected great entities with those potencies, they are known as Āveśa or Śaktyāveśāvatāras. Examples are the four Kumāras (Knowledge), Nārada (Devotion), Brahmā (Creation), Ananta (Gravity), Pṛthu (Sustenance), Paraśurāma (Discipline), and Śeṣa of Vaikuṇṭha (Service). In the tenth canto of <span class=\"e3\">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> (39th chapter), Akrūra is mentioned as having had the darśana of Śeṣa, Nārada, the Kumāras, etc., when immersing himself in the Yamunā for bath.",

Devotion of preliminary faith aroused by following the instructions of the Guru and the scriptures is actuated by obligation to scriptural injunctions, and so devotional sentiment is always limited in that sphere. However, such regulative devotion becomes loving spontaneity when the devotee's attempts to please the Lord by his service gradually deepen. When bhāva or the budding stage of divine love is aroused, the devotee can become a recipient of Kṛṣṇa's grace. To attain this stage takes much time, and such an attempt through devotional service regulated by reverence and scriptural edicts is known as vaidhī-bhakti.",

Others think that by nature God is 'the one', the soul is 'the one', and although the universe or mundane world is 'the one principle', it is eternally distinct in an independent manner; or God is the absolute 'specific', and the relative, both spirit and matter, are the 'specified'—yet all are one truth. Others think that by dint of inconceivable potency the truth sometimes appears as one, sometimes as dual. Yet others conclude that the doctrine of an impotent 'one' is meaningless, so Brahman is replete with pure potency, and it is the eternally pure, one-without-a-second truth.\"",
