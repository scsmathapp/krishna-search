        "I offer my humble obeisances unto His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedānta Swāmī Prabhupāda, who is Krishna’s beloved associate and who came down to this plane from Goloka. Taking the order of his guru on his head, he is the *śaktyāveśa* (empowered) *avatār* of Nityānanda Prabhu personified. He distributed the Hare Krishna mantra all over the Eastern and Western world, delivering and uplifting all fallen souls. He is the best of millions of *jagat-gurus*, because he is the personification of divine mercy. He has distributed the sweet nectar of *Śrīmad Bhāgavatam* and the transcendental knowledge of *Bhagavad-gītā* all over the world. He is constantly engaged in exclusive devotional service to Śrīla Bhakti Siddhānta Saraswatī Ṭhākura, Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī, and Śrī Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu. I offer my humble obeisances unto Śrīla Prabhupāda, who is like a bumblebee always tasting the nectar of the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Govinda."
