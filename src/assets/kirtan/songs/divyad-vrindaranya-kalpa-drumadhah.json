        "I constantly meditate upon that Divine Couple Śrī Śrī Gandharvā-Govinda, who are seated upon a wonderful throne highly decorated with brilliant jewels. They are sitting within the illustrious forest of Vraja, beneath a mind-attracting desire tree, accompanied by Their dedicated servitors such as Śrī Lalitā Devī, Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī and other intimate servants like the *priyanarma sakhīs*."
