        "“I offer my obeisances to Śrīla Bhakti Bimal Avadhūt Mahārāja, the embodiment of Nitāi-Gaura’s compassion. His vast intelligence dwells in endless ways (*vaikuṇṭha vṛtti*) to serve and distribute the highest mercy. An unconventional devotee (*bhaktāvadhūta*) he is pure (*vimal*) as he possesses exclusive dedication to the service of the holy name lotus feet of Govinda (Krishna) and his Guru Śrīla Bhakti Sundar Govinda Dev-Goswāmī.”"
